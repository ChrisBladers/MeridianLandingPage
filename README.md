# MeridianLandingPage

This is a rewrite of the Landing Page I developed at Meridian using a completely different framework and tech stack.
This project is based on AngularJS and ASP.NET and eventually using EntityFrameWork (Code-Fist)
This was done over the weekend for a personal portfolio and is currently an early work in progress.

Another project of this Landing Page will be developed using React & .NET Core.

# TO-DO
- Integrating Code-First EntityFramework
- Refactor Styling and Integrate Responsive Design
- ...

Will update this repo on my free time.
