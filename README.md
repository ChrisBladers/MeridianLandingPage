# MeridianLandingPage

This is a rewrite of the Landing Page I partially designed and fully developed at Meridian.
This rewrite will be using completely different frameworks and tech stacks.
First the project will be based on AngularJS, ASP.NET and EntityFrameWork (Code-Fist) then eventually another version based on React & .NET Core.
This project follows SOLID guildelines with an implementation of DI (IoC) while using the respository pattern.
This was done over the weekend for a personal portfolio and is currently an early work in progress.

# TO-DO
- Integrating Code-First EntityFramework
- Refactor Styling and Integrate Responsive Design
- ...

Will update this repo on my free time.
